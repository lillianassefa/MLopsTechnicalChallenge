AutoModelForSequenceClassification requires the PyTorch library but it was not found in your environment.
However, we were able to find a TensorFlow installation. TensorFlow classes begin
with "TF", but are otherwise identically named to our PyTorch classes. This
means that the TF equivalent of the class you tried to import would be "TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification".
If you want to use TensorFlow, please use TF classes instead!

If you really do want to use PyTorch please go to
https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and follow the instructions that
match your environment.
